            <h1> <big>About Us</big></h1>
            <p>We have created a fictional Blood Donation website.The ABO blood
               group system was discovered in the year 1900 by Karl Landsteiner.
               In India Leela Moolgaokar initiated voluntary blood donation drives
               in Bombay (now Mumbai) from 1954 onwards. She was inspired by the 
               blood need of her injured son.<br><br>

               1) 1667: First Recorded Human Transfusion

                   The first fully documented human blood transfusion was administered in France.
                   King Louis XIV's <br> doctor transfused the blood of a sheep into a 15-year-old boy,<br>
                   who survived.<br><br>


               2) 1818: First Recorded Human-to-Human Transfusion

                   British obstetrician and physiologist James Blundell performs the first recorded<br>
                   human-to-human blood transfusion. He injected a patient suffering from internal<br> 
                   bleeding with 12 to 14 ounces of blood from several donors. The patient died after<br>
                   initially showing improvement.<br><br>
               

               3) 1901: Three Main Blood Groups Discovered
               
                   Discovery of the three main human blood groups, A, B, and C, which is later changed to O.<br>
                   Research charts the regular pattern of reaction that occurs after mingling the serum and <br>
                   red cells of an initial set of six blood specimens.<br><br>
